        <h2>Salami-Cheese-Baguette</h2>
        <p>A Salami-Cheese-Baguette with added paprika, iceberg lettuce and honey.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="ingredients-list-element">Baguette</li>
            <li class="ingredients-list-element">Salami</li>
            <li class="ingredients-list-element">Cheese</li>
            <li class="ingredients-list-element">Paprika</li>
            <li class="ingredients-list-element">Iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li class="ingredients-list-element">Honey</li>
            <li class="ingredients-list-element">Remoulade</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the baguette as specified by the producer.</li>            
            <li>Slice the baguette open length-wise. Don't cut it through completely but leave a small part, both halfs should be connected to each other.
            </li>
            <li>Optional: Add margarine.</li>
            <li>On the entire length of the baguette add a small layer of honey.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese slices.</li>
            <li>Add the remoulade on top of the cheese. It tastes good and helps the salami (next step) to stay in place.</li>
            <li>Add Salami.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice the paprika and add the slices on top of the salami.</li>
            <li>Add lettuce.</li>
            <li>Close the still connected baguette.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Best part: As you may have noticed, there's no weights listed or sizes given. This is deliberate. Want to have 5 slices cheese and 20 Salami? Sure. Want to eat an entire Paprika? Go for it. A few lettuce leaves not enough? Why not add the whole thing and make it a bagutte-salad. Your imagination is the limit (and maybe your stomache). GO NUTS!</li>
            <li>Last note: The finished baguette does not have to look like the picture provided and in fact, if following this recipe, will look nothing like it. Should still be just as tasty as it looks.</li>
        </ol>
